Remove Feed Links is a simple plugin for removing feed links from the head of your web site. 
== Description ==

WordPress always includes links to the RSS and ATOM feeds by default -- but sometimes, you just don't want them.

Maybe your site doesn't have a feed, such as a static brochure site.

Maybe you don't want people using RSS or ATOM to follow the site on a reader, but instead you want them to come directly to the site.

Or maybe you just want to remove every extra character in the code for speed reasons.

For us, it was all three of the above! But we couldn't find a good solution, other than going in and editing directly the templates -- which we try to avoid.

The solution? We built the "Remove Feed Links" plugin which does precisely what you expect: it removes the links, in the HTML the user sees, to the RSS and ATOM feeds that WordPress includes by default.

The plugin Remove Feed Links does that by removing post, comments, and/or extra (category, tags, author) feeds from the head of your site.
